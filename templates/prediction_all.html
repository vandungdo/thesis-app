        <h4>
          Our data set is relatively complicated. We have some classes that
          overlap other class.
        </h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          The data set for classification is the result from clustering step.
          That is impossible to have the balanced data. That is why in each
          classification algorithm, it is necessary to apply the methods to have
          balanced data.
        </h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          The results from classification show, that balanced data give better
          results.
        </h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          The worst algorithm for our problem is Naive Bayes. The reason is the
          dataset has the dependent features.
        </h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          The best algorithm for our problem is Random Forest. It gave the best
          accuracy rate in whole data set, and on each class. The reason is
          Random Forest can work very well for multiclass classification and it
          can prevent from the overfitting problem.
        </h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          The next step is training the whole data set (no more training and
          testing set) with the algorithm Random Forest. Then the model can be
          used to predict / classifier the signals in other csv files in our
          database.
        </h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          For supervised learning, neural net can be used as a classification
          algorithm. In normal case, a neural net for our problem is not
          necessary, but neural net can be applied to have comparision with
          other algorithms in machine learning.
