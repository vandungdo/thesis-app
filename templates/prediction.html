        <h2><strong>Some conclusions from classification</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Our data set is relatively complicated. We have some classes that overlap other class.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>The data set for classification is the result from clustering step. That is impossible to have
                the balanced data. That is why in each classification algorithm, it is necessary to apply the
                methods to have balanced data.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>The results from classification show, that balanced data give better results.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>The worst algorithm for our problem is Naive Bayes. The reason is the dataset has the
                dependent features.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>The best algorithm for our problem is Random Forest. It gave the best accuracy rate in
                whole data set, and on each class. The reason is Random Forest can work very well for
                multiclass classification and it can prevent from the overfitting problem.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>The next step is training the whole data set (no more training and testing set) with the
                algorithm Random Forest. Then the model can be used to predict / classifier the signals in
                other csv files in our database.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>For supervised learning, neural net can be used as a classification algorithm. In normal case,
                a neural net for our problem is not necessary, but neural net can be applied to have
                comparision with other algorithms in machine learning.</h4></li>

        <h2><strong>An example of prediction</strong></h2>
        <h4>The algorithm Random Forest is chosen for building model.</h4>
        <h4>Choosing a csv file that was not included in training data. In this case, the csv file "2018-08-26T06-00-00_VHF_WIDE.csv" was chosen.</h4>

    <h4>The results are good, the classes can be seen from surface plot picture. It can be seen, that in the
        chosen csv file ‘2018-08-26T06-00-00_VHF_WIDE.csv’, there are classes 95, 11, 24, 22, 96.</h4>
    <h4>And from the results, there is still misclassification, the signals should not be classified in the class
        123 and 27. Because from the conclusion in clustering step, the class 123 can only be seen in L
        band, and class 27 can only be seen in UHF band.</h4>
    <h4>The signals in the class ‘unidentified’ are fine, they are noises and can not be detected in other
        classes.</h4>
